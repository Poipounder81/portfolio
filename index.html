          <p>Hello. My name is Ryan. I'm a Technical Engineering Tech at Boeing. I work with a team that focuses on a 3D geometry modeling and data simulation / analysis. With what started as a fun hobby, and now turning into a new career change/added skill, I'll be creating and supporting various works that rely on front-end web development. As for describing what front-end development is, I would say "It's a computer programming focus, that aims to generate and manipulate code that would help develop a webpage aesthetically and provide the significant information to the end-user.</p>
